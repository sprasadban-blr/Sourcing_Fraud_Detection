Anamoly Or Outlier Detection Algorithms
    Supervised
        - KNN
        - One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM)

    UnSupervised
        - Isolation Tree/Forest
        - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
        - Novelty Detection LOF
        - Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)/Kohenen Maps
        - Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)
        - Expectation-Maximization Meta-Algorithm (EM)
        - K-means
        - C-means
        - DBSCAN
        - Autoencoders

    Semi-Supervised
        - First use UnSupervised algorithm - Cluster the data
        - Domain expert manually label the output clusters as outlier's/non outlier
        - Use one class classification algorithm for future prediction


Rule based
 - Classify Fraud/Non fraud (2 or 3 don't mark it)
 - Build classification model
 - Take new data point fraud/non fraud and classify
---------------
Cluster
 - Show different clusters - UI
 - Show outliers with low participation rate - UI
	 - Invited Suppliers
	 - Accepted Suppliers
	 - Participated Suppliers
	 - Awarded Suppliers
	 EventParticipation_AcceptedFlag	
	 EventParticipation_DeclinedFlag	
	 EventParticipation_IntendToRespondFlag	
	 EventParticipation_DeclinedToRespondFlag	
	 EventParticipation_ParticipatedFlag	
	 EventParticipation_AwardedFlag
     EventParticipation_SupplierId
     EventParticipation_SupplierName	
-----------------
- Mark Fraud in UI (mark 1)
	- Rebuild model
- Take new data point fraud/non fraud and classify
